# nomis-dot-emacs

Simon Katz's Emacs init.

Contains:

* `.../dot-emacs-stuff/dot-emacs.el`
    * Loads everything else.
* `.../dot-emacs-stuff/for-anyone`
    * A directory containing things that are probably good for anyone to use.
* `.../dot-emacs-stuff/for-me`
    * A directory containing things that may not be good for anyone other than me to use, either because they are crap or because they may change significantly or because I haven't decided yet that they're ok. Of course, you can copy anything you want or use what's here as a source of ideas.

To use:
* Browse, see what's here, copy stuff and modify it.

or:

* Really use it:
    * Load `.../dot-emacs-stuff/dot-emacs.el` from your .emacs.
      * I do this by having a symbolic link from `~/.emacs` to `.../dot-emacs-stuff/dot-emacs.el`.

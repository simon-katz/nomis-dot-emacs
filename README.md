# nomis-dot-emacs

Simon Katz's Emacs init.

Contains:

* dot-emacs.el
  * Loads everything else.
* for-anyone
  * A directory containing things that are probably good for anyone to use.
* for-me
  * A directory containing things that may not be good for anyone other than me to use, either because they are crap or because they may change significantly or because I haven't decided yet that they're ok. Of course, you can copy anything you want or use what's here as a source of ideas.

- Report this bug in Emacs 24.3:
  - Cycling windows doesn't find any windows.
  - System Preferences » Keyboard » Keyboard Shortcuts » Keyboard and
    Text Input. Look for Move focus to next window in application
  - Command-`.

- Report this bug...
  - What's happened to repetition of keyboard macros? It used to do it
    once; now it repeats until error (I think).

- You have some manually-installed packages in "for-me/nomis-addons".
  Instead, (after .emacs.d and .emacs are in the same repository (if
  you do that)), put the manually-installed packages in .emacs.d.

- Move some stuff from "for-me" to "for-anyone".

- Compiling
  - Look into any compilation errors and warnings now, and do so when
    you make changes.
  - What about compiling these init files? And other ones you manually
    install?
    - Ah, Emacs uses a "newer" check to see if recompilation is needed.
      This isn't going to work for you.

- Consider Emacs Prelude (or parts of it, like the project thing
  which allows grepping across a project).

- Get your nrepl hacking working with new nrepl. Consider doing it properly
  (fork the Git repository, etc) and creating pull requests.

- Stuff from better-defaults:

   ;;   (global-set-key (kbd "M-/") 'hippie-expand)
   ;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-b") 'ibuffer)

- Starter kit
  - See "stuff-from-starter-kit-for-reference.el".

- Need a command for adding `...` around things.
  (Or `...'? `foo` vs `foo' in lisp-mode.) 

- `nomis-nrepl-rearrange-string-into-lines`:
  - Not available everywhere with C-c C-f. Is there a good reason?
  - You want different behaviour from Clojure and everywhere else.
    - Not so: even within Clojure, doc strings and your HTML strings are different.
    - Maybe the command can see what mode is active? (I like this.)
    - Maybe C-c C-f should handle the difference by being bound to different
      commands for Clojure and other things? (I don't like this.)
